      <h1><center>The Family Learning Cycle</center></h1>

      <p>This is a demo of an interactive explainer I designed and built for My Father's World (a homeschooling publisher) in 2015. They had a unique curriculum that they were really struggling to explain to their customers. With most curricula, if you have three kids of different ages, each year you buy three sets of books, and you teach three different classes. Instead, the Family Learning Cycle is designed to let you buy one set of books each year, teaching kids of differing ages the same material at different levels of depth.</p>
      <p>This saves homeschooling parents a lot of time and money, but explaining the details was a major challenge to the business. Written explanations were unapproachably complex; verbal explanations at conventions didn't scale well. Upon learning about the problem, I drew on my love of board games to create this interactive explainer. I drew the graphics in Adobe Illustrator, sought critique from the people who best knew the Family Learning Cycle, and ultimately published it to our website, where 97% of our survey participants indicated it helped them understand how the curriculum worked.</p>
      <p>To make learning easier, we work from simpler to more complex. The first example shows the system with one child, the second example shows it with four children, and at the bottom there's a sandbox mode where you can add as many children as you like.</p>
